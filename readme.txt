== Description ==

A very simple plugin, that will provide you with a custom Gutenberg block. It fetches a random cat picture from a public API and displays it.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/kittymachine` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I put cats on my website ? =

Why not ? If you installed the plugin, you probably already have your own reason anyways ! ;)

= Will the plugin ever see new features ? =

It's unlikely, as it's not meant to be much more than what it is at the moment. But you never know. It will be maintained to remain functional though.


== Changelog ==

= 1.0.0 =
* Release
