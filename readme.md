## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why would I put cats on my website ?

Why not ? If you installed the plugin, you probably already have your own reason anyways ! ;)

### Will the plugin ever see new features ?

It's unlikely, as it's not meant to be much more than what it is at the moment. But you never know. It will be maintained to remain functional though.

Feel free to fork and implement your own features though ! Any high quality update will see its way into the official release.
